-Turns out, you CAN create custom _id for documents
    you just need to annotate it with @Id in the model class
    don't directly insert JsonObjects into the database as it will get messy
    to avoid confusion, if you're going to write custom ids, use _id

for query to retrieve data,
1. Set your criteria, using the Criteria class (read the functions available to you)
2. Instantiate your query, either by Query query = new Query(); or Query query = Query.query(criteria)
3. Send your query using mongoTemplate.find(quey, Document.class, "collectionname");

Special cases
- use .and to add on more conditions for criteria parameters
- use .with with the query AFTER adding the criteria for pagination (e.g for limit or skip)
- use include and exclude respsectively for getting specific columns

Update, Delete, and Insert 
- Almost exactly the same as retrieving
1. Set criteria, using Criteria class
2. Instantiate query with the criteria
3. mongoTemplate update, insert, or delete, use the query, and select the collection

AGGREGATION
A typical pipeline:
Match > Project > Group > Sort > Out 

How to aggregate on java:
1. Write your aggregation operations (MatchOperation, ProjectOperation, GroupOperation, SortOperation,OutOperation)
    these can be found in the Aggregation library
    https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/mongodb/core/aggregation/Aggregation.html
2. Create your pipeline
    Aggregation pipeline = Aggregation.newAggregation(operations... )
3. get the results
    AggregationResults<Document> results = mongoTemplate.aggregate(pipeline, "collection", Document.class)
4. Read the results
    List<Document> docs = results.getMappedResults();  

Using buckets for aggregation is similar. Just use Aggregate.bucket

Referencing multiple collections requires LookupOperation
e.g LookupOperation lookupOperation = Aggregation.lookup("comments", "title_id", "_id", "reviews);
