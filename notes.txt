-Turns out, you CAN create custom _id for documents
    you just need to annotate it with @Id in the model class
    don't directly insert JsonObjects into the database as it will get messy
    to avoid confusion, if you're going to write custom ids, use _id

for query to retrieve data,
1. Set your criteria, using the Criteria class (read the functions available to you)
2. Instantiate your query, either by Query query = new Query(); or Query query = Query.query(criteria)
3. Send your query using mongoTemplate.find(quey, Document.class, "collectionname");

Special cases
- use .and to add on more conditions for criteria parameters
- use .with with the query AFTER adding the criteria for pagination (e.g for limit or skip)
- use include and exclude respsectively for getting specific columns
